# Clinic Management System

* Need to add a timer which emits a signal at regular intervals.
* On receiving the signal data from all input fields would be sent to query.
* And the results will be shown in the treeWidget.
* Need to add threadpool, because database should be accessed by only one thread at a time.

-----

* Need to create a table for patient visits.
Selecting the patient and clicking a button should add the patient to the queue.

* Method for modifying the queue has to be made.

* Another app has to be made which retrieves all patient records from the queue and displays them.
And also accepts new inputs.

* Both apps should work on seperate devices in real time.

-----
* Username and password have be secured.
* Program needs to be compiled or maybe encrpyted.
* List of requirements has to be made.
